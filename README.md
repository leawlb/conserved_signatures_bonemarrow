# Interspecies_BM_phd

This contains my work on the Interspecies Bone Marrow project as part of my PhD. It is derived from my work during my lab rotation (Interspecies_BM_labrotation) and from my master's thesis (Interspecies_BM_mt). To clearly denote what I worked on during what occasion, I have separated these instances.
