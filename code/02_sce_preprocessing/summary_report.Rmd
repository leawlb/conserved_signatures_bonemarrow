Summary report QC for all objects at once.
Some operations from the scripts must be repeated to generate relevant plots,
but any new objects cannot be saved from an .Rmd script.

#### Load libraries, source code 

```{r load,  message = FALSE}

#library(SingleCellExperiment, quietly = TRUE) 
library(DropletUtils, quietly = TRUE) 
#library(tidyverse, quietly = TRUE) 
#library(scater, quietly = TRUE) 
#library(scuttle, quietly = TRUE) 
#library(scran, quietly = TRUE) 

```

```{r load_code, message = FALSE}

#source(file = "../source/colors.R")

sce_01_path <- snakemake@input[["sce_01_path"]]
sce_02_path <- snakemake@input[["sce_02_path"]]
sce_03_path <- snakemake@input[["sce_03_path"]]
sce_04_path <- snakemake@input[["sce_04_path"]]
sce_05_path <- snakemake@input[["sce_05_path"]]

targets <- snakemake@params[["targets"]]
print(targets)
print(sce_01_path)

```

```{r}

object_list_01 <- list()


for(i in targets){
  
  #object_list_01[i] <- readRDS(file = paste(sce_01_path, targets, sep = "_"))
  print(paste(sce_01_path, targets, sep = "/"))
}
